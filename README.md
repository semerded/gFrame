# gFrame

gFrame is built on the widely used pygame library. 
It aims for a more user friendly programming process.

It also comes with a lot of pre-made widgets:
- button
- text
- slider
- popup
- image
- textBox
- roundButton
- ... more in progress

(currently rebuilding gFrame -> updates when rebuild is up to date with old version)
